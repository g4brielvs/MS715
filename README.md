Production Planning and Control

A long line of scientific endeavour addresses problems in the 
manufacturing and agriculture decision-making cycles. The scope of the course comprises the role of planning and control in the context of production of a good or a set of goods. Evaluating whether a production work-flow is effective or not and looking into the future and making forecasts is a very complex task for humans beings.
   
Operations Research techniques contribute to making setting up a production and scheduling plan a more elucidated and mathematically-reasoned decision. In this summary, we had a hands-on experience working with real-world data and statistical models and the opportunity to implement and carry out tests regarding different demand and inventory scenarios and examine the corresponding best obtainable solution.
